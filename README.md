# Text Classification of Legitimate and Rogue Online Privacy Policies

Welcome to the repository for my **Master Thesis Project** titled **"Text Classification of Legitimate and Rogue Online Privacy Policies: Manual Analysis and a Machine Learning Experimental Approach."**

This project investigates the use of **supervised binary classification** to distinguish between legitimate privacy policies from Fortune Global 500 companies and rogue policies from less trustworthy websites. The repository contains the code, data, and documents used in the thesis work.

## Project Overview

In this project, we evaluate **15 classification algorithms** to determine how well they can differentiate between legitimate and rogue privacy policies. The dataset consists of **100 privacy policies** from legitimate websites (top Fortune Global 500 companies) and **67 privacy policies** from rogue websites. A manual analysis was conducted to measure adherence to **seven general privacy principles**, highlighting significant statistical differences between legitimate and rogue policies. 

Our findings show that privacy policies from legitimate companies have **98% adherence** to the seven privacy principles, compared to only **45% adherence** in rogue companies' policies. After evaluating the classification models, the **Na√Øve Bayes Multinomial** algorithm exhibited the best performance with an **AUC score of 0.90 (0.08)**, outperforming other candidates in statistical tests.

You can find a more detailed abstract and analysis in the full thesis document, accessible [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1045553/FULLTEXT02).
